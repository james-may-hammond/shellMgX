In this project I aim to make a simple shell using rust, before i start this entry i would like to describe exactly what I mean by the shell here cause a shell is perpetuity is something much more complex than what we're trying to create.  A shell is something that allows one to control the computer, not always in obvious means. Now the most common way to interact with a shell is through some sort of terminal like (CUI) interface and that is sort of what I am going to try to build.
